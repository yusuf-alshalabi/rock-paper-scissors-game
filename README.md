# Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using C++.

## 📋 Features
- Human vs Computer gameplay
- Input validation
- Random computer moves
- Score tracking
- Clear code structure with comments
- Modular design following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Library
- CMD (for building and running)

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The player is prompted to enter a choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
2. The computer randomly generates a move.
3. The result is calculated and displayed.
4. The game continues until the user decides to exit.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Compile the code using any C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o rps
   ./rps
   ```
2. Or run it using an IDE like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, etc.

## 📝 Notes
- The code includes input validation to prevent invalid entries.
- You can modify the number of rounds or add enhancements like score saving.
